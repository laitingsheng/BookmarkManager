# British Spelling Standards

Always use British English spelling conventions throughout the codebase, documentation, and all generated content.

## Key Spelling Rules

- Use "-ise" endings instead of "-ize" (e.g., "organise" not "organize", "realise" not "realize")
- Use "-our" endings instead of "-or" (e.g., "colour" not "color", "behaviour" not "behavior")
- Use "-re" endings instead of "-er" (e.g., "centre" not "center", "theatre" not "theater")
- Use "-ence" instead of "-ense" (e.g., "defence" not "defense", "licence" not "license")
- Use single "l" in words like "travelling", "modelling", "cancelled"

## Common Examples

- organisation (not organization)
- colour (not color)
- centre (not center)
- realise (not realize)
- optimise (not optimize)
- analyse (not analyze)
- behaviour (not behavior)
- favourite (not favorite)
- honour (not honor)
- labour (not labor)
- neighbour (not neighbor)
- programme (not program, except for computer programs)
- grey (not gray)
- defence (not defense)
- licence (noun, not license)
- practise (verb, not practice)

This applies to all code comments, documentation, user-facing text, variable names, and any generated content.
