# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the URL rewriting system in the Chrome extension. This advanced feature allows users to transform bookmark URLs using regular expression patterns for bulk URL standardisation and cleanup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create URL rewriting rules using regular expressions, so that I can define patterns for transforming bookmark URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a rewrite rule THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify a regular expression pattern
2. WHEN I define a rule THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify a replacement string with capture group references
3. WHEN I enter a regex pattern THEN the system SHALL validate the syntax before allowing rule creation
4. WHEN I save rewrite rules THEN the system SHALL store them persistently in Chrome's sync storage
5. WHEN I modify existing rules THEN the system SHALL update the stored configuration immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to apply URL rewriting rules to my bookmarks, so that I can transform URLs in bulk according to my defined patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute URL rewriting THEN the system SHALL apply all enabled rules to matching bookmark URLs
2. WHEN a bookmark URL matches a pattern THEN the system SHALL transform it using the corresponding replacement string
3. WHEN URL transformation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other bookmarks
4. WHEN rewriting completes THEN the system SHALL update the affected bookmarks in Chrome's bookmark API
5. WHEN I execute rewriting THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of how many URLs were transformed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be warned about the permanent nature of URL rewriting, so that I understand the risks before applying transformations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the URL rewriting section THEN the system SHALL display warnings about the permanent nature of changes
2. WHEN I attempt to execute rewriting THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation before proceeding
3. WHEN I create complex regex patterns THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on proper regex syntax
4. WHEN rewriting would affect many bookmarks THEN the system SHALL display the count before execution
5. WHEN I use capture groups THEN the system SHALL provide examples of proper replacement string syntax

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my rewriting rules through an intuitive interface, so that I can easily add, edit, and remove URL transformation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the rewriting rules section THEN the system SHALL display all existing rules in a clear list format
2. WHEN I add a new rule THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for pattern and replacement strings
3. WHEN I edit an existing rule THEN the system SHALL populate the fields with current values for modification
4. WHEN I delete a rule THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage and update the interface immediately
5. WHEN I test a pattern THEN the system SHALL provide a way to preview transformations before applying them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my rewriting rules to synchronise across devices, so that I can maintain consistent URL transformation patterns on all my Chrome installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create rules on one device THEN the system SHALL synchronise them to all my Chrome instances
2. WHEN I modify rules THEN the system SHALL update them across all devices automatically
3. WHEN I start the extension THEN the system SHALL load my saved rules from Chrome's sync storage
4. WHEN storage changes occur THEN the system SHALL update the interface to reflect the new settings
5. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL use the most recent rule configuration
