# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the core bookmark tree view and editing functionality in the Chrome extension. This focuses specifically on displaying bookmarks in a hierarchical structure and providing editing capabilities for bookmark properties.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my bookmarks in a tree structure, so that I can easily navigate my bookmark hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the extension options THEN the system SHALL display my bookmarks in an expandable tree view
2. WHEN I have bookmark folders THEN the system SHALL show them with folder icons and allow expansion/collapse
3. WHEN I toggle "Folder Only" mode THEN the system SHALL hide individual bookmarks and show only folders
4. WHEN bookmarks are modified in Chrome THEN the system SHALL automatically update the tree view in real-time
5. WHEN the tree loads THEN the system SHALL show both "Bookmarks Bar" and "Other Bookmarks" as root folders

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit bookmark properties, so that I can update titles and URLs to keep my bookmarks organised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable editing mode THEN the system SHALL allow me to modify bookmark titles and URLs
2. WHEN editing is disabled THEN the system SHALL protect bookmarks from accidental modifications
3. WHEN I click on a bookmark or folder THEN the system SHALL open a modal dialogue for editing properties
4. WHEN I save bookmark changes THEN the system SHALL synchronise the changes with Chrome's bookmark API
5. WHEN I try to edit system folders THEN the system SHALL prevent modifications to protected folders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time bookmark synchronisation, so that the interface stays current with Chrome's bookmark changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bookmark is created in Chrome THEN the system SHALL add it to the tree view immediately
2. WHEN a bookmark is deleted in Chrome THEN the system SHALL remove it from the tree view immediately
3. WHEN a bookmark is moved in Chrome THEN the system SHALL update its position in the tree view immediately
4. WHEN a bookmark is modified in Chrome THEN the system SHALL update its properties in the tree view immediately
5. WHEN bookmark events occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without requiring a page refresh
