# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for initialising a Chrome extension project for bookmark management. The project is a browser extension that provides advanced bookmark organisation, cleaning, and URL rewriting capabilities for Chromium-based browsers. It uses modern web technologies including Vue.js 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Chrome Extensions Manifest V3 API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a modern Chrome extension development environment, so that I can build a bookmark management extension with Vue.js and TypeScript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialised THEN the system SHALL create a package.json with Vue.js 3, TypeScript, and Vite configuration
2. WHEN the project is initialised THEN the system SHALL configure TypeScript with strict type checking and Chrome API types
3. WHEN the project is initialised THEN the system SHALL set up Vite build system with custom manifest generation
4. WHEN the project is initialised THEN the system SHALL configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
5. WHEN the project is initialised THEN the system SHALL include TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish the Chrome extension structure, so that I can create a functional browser extension with proper manifest configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension structure is created THEN the system SHALL generate a manifest.json with Manifest V3 specification
2. WHEN the extension structure is created THEN the system SHALL configure required permissions for bookmarks, history, and storage
3. WHEN the extension structure is created THEN the system SHALL create HTML entry points for options and popup pages
4. WHEN the extension structure is created THEN the system SHALL set up a service worker background script
5. WHEN the extension structure is created THEN the system SHALL generate multi-resolution icons from a base favicon

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create the application architecture, so that I can build a scalable Vue.js application with proper state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application architecture is established THEN the system SHALL create Vue.js entry points for options and popup interfaces
2. WHEN the application architecture is established THEN the system SHALL set up Pinia stores for state management
3. WHEN the application architecture is established THEN the system SHALL create TypeScript type definitions for all data models
4. WHEN the application architecture is established THEN the system SHALL establish reactive state management for user preferences
5. WHEN the application architecture is established THEN the system SHALL create a component-based architecture for UI elements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish development and build processes, so that I can efficiently develop and deploy the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development process is established THEN the system SHALL configure development server with hot reload
2. WHEN the development process is established THEN the system SHALL set up build process for production deployment
3. WHEN the development process is established THEN the system SHALL configure automated icon generation from base favicon
4. WHEN the development process is established THEN the system SHALL implement dynamic manifest generation from package.json
5. WHEN the development process is established THEN the system SHALL set up code formatting and linting automation
